# Hi! I am Anjo Serohijos 

I am a dedicated full-stack developer from Philippines! I am passionate about building tech-related stuffs, especially web and mobile development! I am currently working as a SAP C4C Developer to program Cloud-based apps in SAP. In my free time, I usually study either new tech project, or work on a freelance project. I am heavily invested in Dart/Flutter, Java, Kotlin, and Web3. If you have any suggestions, comments, or something I could help you with, feel free to connect with me!
